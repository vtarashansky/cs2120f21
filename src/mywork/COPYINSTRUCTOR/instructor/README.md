# Instructor directory

This /src/instructor directory is where Prof. Sullivan will put files for you.  

Please do *not* create, edit, or delete files in this directory, otherwise you will encounter git *merge conflicts*, which occur when your changes to a file or directory conflict with those made to the *upstream* repository by Prof. Sullivan. Download new or changed files from Prof. Sullivan's *upstream* repository using the following command, entered in a terminal/shell.

``` sh
git pull upstream main
```
